🌌 SINCARA+
A modern continuation of the original Fusion client — optimized, feature-rich, and open-source for 1.7.10 & 1.8.9.

Sincara+ is a powerful Minecraft client made for versions 1.7.10 and 1.8.9, packed with combat, movement, visual, inventory, and utility modules — plus a clean internal GUI and a dedicated injector for easy setup.

This project builds on the legacy of the original Fusion (by deity and others), which is no longer maintained. Sincara+ picks up the torch and aims to push the project further with new features, improved performance, and enhanced usability.
